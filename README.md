# Bespoke Bakery

This is a project in construction.
A simple CRUD that simulates a bespoke bakery, where you can place an order for bakery products. Our goal in future is to provide two client types: regular bakery and final customer.

This project uses Spring Boot, JSF/Primefaces, JPA with H2 in-memory, all assembled by Maven.
This project uses embedded Tomcat provided by Spring Boot.
To run as a maven project, use mvn spring-boot:run.
